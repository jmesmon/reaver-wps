TODO:
	remove unused source files
	make CONF_DIR runtime configurable. Default to somewhere in $HOME.
	Fix all the warnings/errors
	Switch internal code to common external libs
		- bignum -> gmp
		- tommath excerpt to libtommath
		- crypto/ is extracted from wps_supplicant, look at using
		  wpa_supplicant in a submodule.

	use ccan instead of some of the stuff in utils/ and wpa/wpabuf

	- figure out if we really need sqlite3 or can just use some files in directories.
		- bully uses plain text files

	examine making keys.c a text file we load at runtime. Or at least generate that at build time.
